# Car Billiards

Small game to study and practice 3D technologies.

**Game idea**: various simple 3D objects (cubes, balls, etc.) and a car are scattered on the game "table". When you tap/click on the screen, the car starts moving straight to the specified point.
If during the movement the car collides with an object, then it pushes it. The goal is to push all the objects off the table.
